User Story 1 (10 PTS): As a game player, I want an improved GUI for the Adventure game,
                so that I can play the game on an Android device.

    @Acceptance Criteria:
        -The game works on an Android device emulation, or an actual Android device.
          All commands available in previous versions of the game are accessible and work properly
          on the Android device.


Split Story A (8 PTS): As a CS 314 student, I want to create a new GUI as a new game view,
                  so that the game will run on an Android device. (See the Notes in the Description section
                  below for additional information you need to deliver the acceptance criteria listed below.)
    @Acceptance Criteria (AC):
        - The new interface works on the Android platform.
        - The game retains its Model-View separation design: All 'view' software only accesses functional
            parts of the game through the AdventureGameModelFacade class.
        - New tests for your Android Java code are written and pass. Any defects they find are fixed.
        - All previous JUnit tests are run and pass.
        - Meet 'Definition of Done' (DoD), below.

    @Tasks (estimation/actual time):
        *(1hr/.5hr) Download and install Android Studio
        *(4hrs/4hrs) Learn how to use Android Studio
        *(2hrs/2.5hrs) Build project and get Github to work with Android Studio
        *(3hrs/3hrs) Add button functionality
        *(2hrs/1hr) Test application
        *(.5hr/.5hr) Document Work
        *(1hr/1hr) Ensure that DoD and rubric are both met




---------------------------------------------------------------
@ Definition of Done:
For all user stories:

    - GitHub main branch code runs with no warnings and a user can execute all commands at least using the GUI.
    - All code changes are reviewed before being merged onto the main branch (see A1, tutorial 5
        for instructions on the GitHub Pull Request Code Review System you must use for reviews)
    - All code changes are merged into the main branch

For CS314 development:

    - All work is done on individual branches with frequent commits and pushes to GitHub
        before being merged onto the main branch.
    - Commit messages include user story and task
    - All user stories and point estimates are in GitHub
    - All tasks and time estimates and actual time taken are in GitHub
    - The overview.txt file for A4 has all required items in it
