User Story 1. As a game player, I want to use a GUI
              so that the Adventure game is easier to play.

    @Acceptance Criteria:
        The game uses a GUI for all commands previously available as text commands.
        


Split Story B. (8 SP) As a CS 314 student, I want to implement Dr. Bieman's
               model-view separation design and get the game working with this GUI.
    @Acceptance Criteria:
          - The game uses a BreezeSwing GUI for all commands previously
             available as text commands.

    @Tasks (estimation/actual time):
          *(1hr) Learn BreezySwing
          *(1hr) Learn JUnit
          *(2hr) Study class diagram and code and figure out what code needs
            to be added to connect facade methods to AdventureGame code.
            Add code accordingly.
          *(1hr) Create JUnit tests for allnew methods added to any class and for all
            methods in new classes.
          *(1hr) Move all text string output and make sure it is included in the GUI correctly.

@ Definition of Done:
For all user stories:
- GitHub main branch code runs with no warnings and a user can
   access a GUI to execute all commands that were possible from the command line version
- All code changes are reviewed before being merged onto the main branch (see A1,
   tutorial 5 for instructions on the GitHub Pull Request Code Review System you must
   use for reviews)
- All code changes are merged into the main branch
- All code is unit tested and all tests pass

For CS314 development:
- All work is done on individual branches with frequent commits and pushes to
   GitHub before being merged onto the main branch (do frequent commits and
   pushes to prevent losing work, and do pushes so others can use your work)
- Commit messages include user story and task
- All user stories and point estimates are in GitHub
- All tasks and time estimates and actual time taken are in GitHub
- The overview.txt file for A2 has all required items in it
