@Specific contributions by each person:
-----------------------------------------------
-Alex Day: 	Developed interface to run Adventure Game on Android device. this included
            implementing buttons and selector controls as well as interaction with text
            output generated from the model facade. Worked with Adrion to fix bugs that
            were not found in A3.

@Challenges Faced while replacing GUI:
-----------------------------------------------
1)  Getting Android Studio to work smoothly, and function with Github was
    definitely one of the harder tasks of the assignment. It seemed like there were
    endless bugs, and fixing one would lead to another.

2)  Deciding on Android interface views to appropriately interact with the Adventure Game
    took a good deal of trial and error. The difficult selection process of appropriate views was
    eased with lots of Google searches. Using the RelativeLayout was a pain to use
    as small changes in the position on one View often resulted in dramatic, undesired changes
    in the entire layout.

3)  Adding new prompts in order to aid the user in understanding how to play the game was difficult
    as it required analysis of the Android View's logic aspects that are not immediately obvious.

4)  Using the RelativeLayout was a pain to use as small changes in the position on one View often
    resulted in dramatic, undesired changes in the entire layout. The only way to solve the issues
    that it presented was with patience and diligence in correcting the error as they were created.

@User Interface Evaluation:
------------------------------------------------
Goal 1: Efficiency of the user interacting with the user interface
  to complete a task based on typical tasks:
  - Question 1: How simple is the layout of the interface?

    Answer/Assessment: The layout is pretty self-explanatory.
    Dropping and picking up items might be a little confusing at first,
    but it seems simple enough to work. The layout does not offer many
    instructions to the user as to how it is to be used, however due to
    the simplicity of the game it is fairly easy to figure out.

  - Question 2: How does the interface respond to gameplay?

    Answer/Assessment: It does not lag and responds to input as expected,
    however, due to the text view constantly changing size the interface gets
    moved around. The issue of the interface resizing does not hinder functionality
    as all features that are needed for the user to interact with the game are always
    available. However, this is only the case in portrait layout mode, if the screen is
    rotated to landscape mode the buttons move off of the screen. Correcting this would
    help the functionality of the game as it is moved to various devices.

Goal 2: Effectiveness of the user interface in causing the program to
  follow the user's intent based on typical tasks:
  - Question 1: How easy is it for the user to navigate through a given adventure with the interface?

    Answer/Assessment: Controls are simple enough to allow the user to navigate and explore
    the adventure. There are prompts that notify the user of the current situation as buttons are
    clicked, such as whether there are items to drop or pick up as well as when they need to select
    an item. There is also a short greeting prompt that does not describe functionality but serves
    to set up the game- as opposed to just entering the game without a prompt.

  - Question 2: How easy is it to interact with items i.e. pick up, drop, and use items?

    Answer/Assessment: Functionality of all of these actions were thoroughly tested and are
    simple enough for anybody to use. It does take two steps to pick up/drop items, but that comes
    with the feature of having multiple items in the game. Using items is still done automatically
    by the game, with the only item that has "use" being keys. Future interaction could include
    being able to sell the bag of gold bars to a random dude hanging outside the cave when you exit.
