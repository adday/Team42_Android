@Challenges Faced while replacing GUI:
-----------------------------------------------
1)  Getting Android Studio to work smoothly, and function with Github was
    definitely one of the harder tasks of the assignment. It seemed like there were
    endless bugs, and fixing one would lead to another.

@User Interface Evaluation:
------------------------------------------------
Goal 1: Efficiency of the user interacting with the user interface
  to complete a task based on typical tasks:
  - Question 1: How simple is the layout of the interface?

    Answer/Assessment: The layout is pretty self-explanatory.
    Dropping and picking up items might be a little confusing at first,
    but it seems simple enough to work.

  - Question 2: How does the interface respond to gameplay?

    Answer/Assessment: It does not lag and responds to input as expected,
    however, due to the text view constantly changing size the interface gets
    moved around.

Goal 2: Effectiveness of the user interface in causing the program to
  follow the user's intent based on typical tasks:
  - Question 1: How easy is it for the user to navigate through a given adventure with the interface?

    Answer/Assessment: Controls are simple enough to allow the user to navigate and explore
    the adventure.

  - Question 2: How easy is it to interact with items i.e. pick up, drop, and use items?

    Answer/Assessment: Functionality of all of these actions were thoroughly tested and are
    simple enough for anybody to use. It does take two steps to pick up/drop items, but that comes
    with the feature of having multiple items in the game.
