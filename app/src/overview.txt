@Description of Difficulty Mechanism:
------------------------------------------------
Added false keys and a flashlight in a new level(level 1). This can potentially trick
the player as well as makes the skill of item management more important as the flashlight can
help, but you can only have 2 items at a time so players must choose when to have keys, flashlights,
or treasure. Players can also get stuck if they play the level incorrectly.

@Abstract Factory design implementation:
------------------------------------------------
The abstract factory is implemented to create a cave configuration depending on a user selected level
of 0 or 1. Each adventure factory defines a cave layout and places items in the rooms according to the
programmer design. The factories also have a method that creates a saved adventure so that when a
user selects to load a saved adventure the cave is configured appropriately. The factory to use is
determined in the adventure game model facade.

@Description of other Game Enhancements:
------------------------------------------------
Added save and load functionality so users can continue their games without losing progress.
Added a new item called a flashlight that makes navigating levels a lot easier by changing the UI
to indicate what directions the user can go in.

@User Needs to Know:
------------------------------------------------
1. The game auto-saves on exit
2. Load game defaults to the beginning of level zero if nothing has been saved
3. Each level is won by bringing the treasure outside
4. Gameplay instructions are available in the start-up screen

@Special Instructions:
------------------------------------------------
How to use the flashlight:
    -Green text on the UI means there is another room in that direction
    -Red text on the UI means there is a door in that direction
    -No text on the UI means there is a wall in that direction
    -User must have the flashlight picked up in order to use it
